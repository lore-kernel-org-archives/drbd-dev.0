I'l rebase it to latest Linus tree and re-run DM stripe testing.

How about adding some counters to record, for example, how many time
->merge_bvec is called in old kernel and how many time bio splitting is called

I'm OK to target the 4.3 merge.
But hope we can get it into linux-next tree ASAP for more wide tests.
