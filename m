I'll test XFS on DM and also what Christoph suggested:

Kent's Direct IO rewrite patch depends on this series.
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/mlin/linux.git/log/?h=block-dio-rewrite

I did test the dio patch on a 2 sockets(48 logical CPUs) server and
saw 40% improvement with 48 null_blks.
Here is the fio data of 4k read.

4.1-rc2
----------
Test 1: bw=50509MB/s, iops=12930K
Test 2: bw=49745MB/s, iops=12735K
Test 3: bw=50297MB/s, iops=12876K,
Average: bw=50183MB/s, iops=12847K

4.1-rc2-dio-rewrite
------------------------
Test 1: bw=70269MB/s, iops=17989K
Test 2: bw=70097MB/s, iops=17945K
Test 3: bw=70907MB/s, iops=18152K
Average: bw=70424MB/s, iops=18028K
